# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Financial-News

# Overview
This project demonstrates the application of LLaMA-3 (Large Language Model Meta AI) for sentiment analysis. The model is fine-tuned to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Leveraging the powerful transformer-based architecture of LLaMA-3, this project aims to achieve high accuracy in sentiment prediction, particularly for social media data like tweets.

# Features
Sentiment Classification: Classifies text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories.
Preprocessing: Includes data preprocessing techniques like tokenization, padding, and sequence truncation.
Fine-tuning: Demonstrates the fine-tuning process of the LLaMA-3 model on sentiment analysis data.
Evaluation: Provides model evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Dataset
The project uses the Kaggle Sentiment Analysis Dataset to train and test the model. The dataset contains labeled text data with sentiment annotations.
